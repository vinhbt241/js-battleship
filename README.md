# JS Battleship

## Purpose
This project was build to get familiar with TDD. I'm using Jest for this process.

## What I Learn
Suprisingly, TDD help me code faster (at first I thought it was a waste of time). Still, there are DOM functions or random-generated command functions that I don't known how to test, which took me long time to code using my old process. Gonna need to take a supplement course later to solve this problem.
